API Reference

This page shows pricing information to help you understand API costs.For billing setup, payment methods, and usage monitoring, visit the Admin section. For rate limits, see the Rate Limits & Usage Tiers page.

## Agent API Pricing

The Agent API provides access to third-party models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI with transparent, token-based pricing at direct provider rates with no markup.

### Model Pricing

Agent API pricing varies by provider and model, with each provider offering multiple models at different price points.

See the full pricing breakdown for all available models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI, including cache rates and provider documentation links on the Agent API Models page.

### Tool Pricing

When using tools with the Agent API:

| Tool | Price | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `web_search` | $0.005 per invocation | Performs web searches to retrieve current information |
| `fetch_url` | $0.0005 per invocation | Fetches and extracts content from specific URLs |
| `people_search` | $0.005 per invocation | Looks up professionals, employees, and people. $5 per 1,000 tool invocations |
| `finance_search` | $0.005 per invocation | Retrieves financial data and market information. $5 per 1,000 tool invocations |

Tool costs are separate from model token costs. Each tool invocation is billed individually — if a model makes 3 `web_search` calls and 2 `people_search` calls during a request, you pay model tokens + (3 × $0.005) + (2 × $0.005) for tools.

## Search API Pricing

| API | Price per 1K requests | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Search API | $5.00 | Raw web search results with advanced filtering |

No token costs: Search API charges per request only, with no additional token-based pricing.

## Sonar API Pricing

Total cost per query = Token costs + Request fee (varies by search context size, applies to Sonar, Sonar Pro, and Sonar Reasoning Pro models only)

- Token Pricing
- Request Pricing
- Pro Search Pricing

## Token Pricing

Token pricing is based on the number of tokens in your request and response.

| Model | Input Tokens ($/1M) | Output Tokens ($/1M) | Citation Tokens ($/1M) | Search Queries ($/1K) | Reasoning Tokens ($/1M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sonar | $1 | $1 | - | - | - |
| Sonar Pro | $3 | $15 | - | - | - |
| Sonar Reasoning Pro | $2 | $8 | - | - | - |
| Sonar Deep Research | $2 | $8 | $2 | $5 | $3 |

## Request Pricing by Search Context Size

Search context determines how much web information is retrieved. Higher context = more comprehensive results. The following table shows the request fee for each model for every 1000 requests.

| Model | Low Context Size | Medium Context Size | High Context Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sonar | $5 | $8 | $12 |
| Sonar Pro | $6 | $10 | $14 |
| Sonar Reasoning Pro | $6 | $10 | $14 |

- Low: (default) fastest, cheapest
- Medium: Balanced cost/quality
- High: Maximum search depth, best for research

## Pro Search Pricing (Pro Search for Sonar Pro)

Pro Search enhances Sonar Pro with automated tool usage and multi-step reasoning. When enabled, the model can perform multiple web searches and fetch URL content to answer complex queries. Learn more about Pro Search here.

Pro Search requires `stream: true` and is enabled via the `search_type` parameter in `web_search_options`.

### Search Type Options

| Search Type | Description | Request Fee (per 1K) |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | (default) Standard Sonar Pro behavior | $6 / $10 / $14 |
| `pro` | Multi-step tool usage for complex queries | $14 / $18 / $22 |
| `auto` | Automatic classification based on query complexity | Varies by classification |

Request fees vary by search context size (Low / Medium / High). Token pricing remains the same as standard Sonar Pro ($3 per 1M input, $15 per 1M output).

## Embeddings API Pricing

Generate high-quality text embeddings for semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and other machine learning applications.

### Standard Embeddings

| Model | Dimensions | Price ($/1M tokens) |
|---|---|---|
| `pplx-embed-v1-0.6b` | 1024 | $0.004 |
| `pplx-embed-v1-4b` | 2560 | $0.03 |

### Contextualized Embeddings

| Model | Dimensions | Price ($/1M tokens) |
|---|---|---|
| `pplx-embed-context-v1-0.6b` | 1024 | $0.008 |
| `pplx-embed-context-v1-4b` | 2560 | $0.05 |

Token and Cost Glossary

### Input Tokens

The number of tokens in your prompt or message to the API. This includes:

- Your question or instruction
- Any context or examples you provide
- System messages and formatting

Example: "What is the weather in New York?" = ~8 input tokens

### Output Tokens

The number of tokens in the API's response. This includes:

- The generated answer or content
- Any explanations or additional context
- Search results and references

Example: "The weather in New York is currently sunny with a temperature of 72°F." = ~15 output tokens

### Citation Tokens

Tokens used specifically for generating search results and references in responses. Only applies to Sonar Deep Research model.Example: Including source links, reference numbers, and bibliographic information

### Search Context Size vs Context Window

Search context size is not the same as the context window.

- Search context size: How much web information is retrieved during search (affects request pricing)
- Context window: Maximum tokens the model can process in one request (affects token limits)

### Search Queries

The number of individual searches conducted by Sonar Deep Research during query processing. This is separate from your initial user query.

- The model automatically determines how many searches are needed
- You cannot control the exact number of search queries
- The `reasoning_effort` parameter influences the number of searches performed
- Only applies to Sonar Deep Research model

### Reasoning Tokens

Tokens used for step-by-step logical reasoning and problem-solving. Only applies to Sonar Deep Research model.Example: Breaking down a complex math problem into sequential steps with explanations

Token Calculation: 1 token ≈ 4 characters in English text. The exact count may vary based on language and content complexity.
